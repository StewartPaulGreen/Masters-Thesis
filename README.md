Datacleaning code for my thesis on the effects of the Affordable Care Act on health insurance rates and labor supply.

Standard variable creation and data manipulation.
Line 105 for the aggregated PUMAs was the most interesting variable to create.

The rest of the analysis was done using STATA code for multiple variations of fixed effect regressions.
